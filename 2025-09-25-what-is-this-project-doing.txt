 Tips for getting started:

 1. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 2. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 3. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude

> what is this project doing?

● I'll examine this project to understand what it does.

● Let me examine the key files to understand what this Android GPS project does.

● Read(app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml)
  ⎿  Read 26 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\src\main\java\br\tmvdl\gps\MainActivity.kt)
  ⎿  Read 59 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\src\main\res\values\strings.xml)
  ⎿  Read 46 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me also check the fragments to get a better understanding:

● Read(app\src\main\java\br\tmvdl\gps\FirstFragment.kt)
  ⎿  Read 44 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\build.gradle.kts)
  ⎿  Read 52 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● This is a basic Android application template project named "GPS" but it doesn't actually implement GPS functionality yet.
  Here's what it contains:

  - Package: br.tmvdl.gps (Brazilian domain, likely someone's initials: tmvdl)
  - App Name: "gps"
  - Structure: Standard Android Navigation Component template with:
    - MainActivity with toolbar and floating action button
    - Two fragments (FirstFragment, SecondFragment) with basic navigation
    - Material Design components
    - View binding enabled

  Currently it's just the default Android Studio template - no GPS functionality has been implemented. The fragments contain
  placeholder content and lorem ipsum text. The FAB shows a generic "Replace with your own action" snackbar.

  The project appears to be a starting point for developing a GPS-related Android application, but no location services, maps,
  or GPS functionality has been added yet.

> /init is analyzing your codebase… 

● I'll analyze the codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file to help future instances understand this Android GPS project.

     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
     ## Project Overview
     This is an Android application project named "GPS" (`br.tmvdl.gps`) built with Kotlin and Android Gradle Plugin 8.13.0.
     Currently, it contains only the standard Android Studio template structure with Navigation Components - no actual GPS
     functionality has been implemented yet.
     ## Build Commands

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze project structure and build configuration       
     ☒ Check for existing documentation and configuration files
     ☒ Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md file
     ☒ Examine Gradle build files and dependencies

● I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that provides future Claude instances with:

  - Project overview - Android GPS app template with Navigation Components
  - Build commands - Standard Gradle commands for Android development
  - Architecture details - Single-activity with Navigation Component structure
  - Development context - Fresh template ready for GPS functionality implementation

  The file focuses on the high-level architecture and essential commands while avoiding generic development practices or obvious
   instructions.
